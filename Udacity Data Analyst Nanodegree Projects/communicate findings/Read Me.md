## Summary of Findings

In the exploration of the dataset, I try to find features that can be indicative of Heart Disease. 

First, I explored some selected features as a univariate distribution to better understand each feature. After which, I started looking at the

relationship between some selected features and the feature of interest (Heart Disease). 

Only two features stood out, out of the features to be indicative of Heart Disease, Smoking and Stroke.

Proportion of smoking respondents with Heart Diseases is circa twice respondents who don't smoke.

Also, proportion of respondents with stroke and having Heart Disease is circa 5 times respondents with no stroke but have Heart Disease.

Other features such as Alcohol Drinking, Mental Health and Physical Health didn't seem to be an effective indicative of Heart Disease.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focused on the two features that can be indicative of Heart Disease across BMI group and Sex.

For the BMI group, since there are 3 categorical variables, I used faceting to be able to show the relationship.

Same approach was used for the Sex.

Healthy Weight tends to suffer the least of Heart Disease regardless of whether the respondents smokes or not. The same was observed whether 

respondents have stroke or not.

Male Respondents tends to suffer more of Heart Disease regardless of whether the respondents smokes or not. The same was observed whether the 

respondents have stroke or not.
